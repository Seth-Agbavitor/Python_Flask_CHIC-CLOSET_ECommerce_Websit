# Web Development: (CHIC CLOSET) An E-Commerce Website

This is an e-commerce web application developed using Python Flask, HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Jinja2, SQLite, jQuery, and Bootstrap. This platform features a display gallery showcasing various clothing products, each with an accompanying image, name, price, and a concise form to add items to the shopping cart. The details of these clothing items are stored within a SQLite database and presented using Bootstrapâ€™s card layout.

The website offers filtering functionality, enabling users to browse through the inventory by various categories such as Shirts, Pants, Shoes, and different price ranges. These filters are implemented using SQL queries to facilitate easy navigation through the product offerings.
