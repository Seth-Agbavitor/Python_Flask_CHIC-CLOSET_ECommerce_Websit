Application Description:
Our application aims to create a user-friendly e-commerce platform exclusively for men's shirts. Users will be able to browse through a diverse collection of shirts, filter their options based on various criteria, and make purchases securely. Additionally, the platform will provide features for user authentication, allowing customers to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.


Data Storage:
In our application, data will primarily be stored in an SQLite database. This database will contain information about users, including usernames, passwords (encrypted), and profile details. Moreover, product-related data such as shirt details (e.g., name, description, price, size, color) and order information will also be stored in the database.

Technologies and Frameworks:
For the backend development, we will utilize Flask as our web server framework, ensuring efficient routing and handling of HTTP requests. 

Data storage will be managed using SQLite, providing a lightweight and scalable solution. Additionally, we will implement a REST API to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend components.

On the frontend, we will employ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface. Vue.js will be utilized to enhance the dynamic aspects of the application, such as real-time updates and component-based architecture.


Functionality:
User Authentication: Users will be able to register new accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
Product Browsing: Customers can browse through a wide range of men's shirts, filter options based on size, color, price, etc., and view detailed product descriptions.
Shopping Cart: Users will have the ability to add items to their shopping cart, review cart contents, and proceed to checkout securely.
Order Management: Registered users will be able to view their order history and track the status of their current orders.
Additional Features: We plan to implement features such as product reviews to enhance the overall shopping experience.


Project Delivery:
We will deliver the project with complete code stored in a GitHub repository. Additionally, a comprehensive README.md file will provide instructions for running the application, testing procedures, and a list of all implemented functionality. A SQLite database containing example data will also be included in the project delivery.
